*jobhunter* is a tool to find jobs that I am specifically looking for.

This tool is free to use and modify. If you get some use out of it, or if you have any questions, I'd love to know. You can find me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/onlymattjohnson) or on the [web](http://www.onlymattjohnson.com).
